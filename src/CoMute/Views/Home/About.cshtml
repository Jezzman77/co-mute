<b>
    With ever rising fuel prices and increased traffic on our roads,<br /> the Co-Mute project was started in an
    effort to help alleviate some of these pressures. <br />Car-pooling can cut on travelling and vehicle
    maintenance costs. It also enables more effective use <br /> of commuters’ time, as time spent driving
    could be spent more productively.
